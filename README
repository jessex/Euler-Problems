DESCRIPTION

These are my solutions to the problems at Project Euler, written entirely in 
Scala.

As the project describes itself, "Project Euler is a series of challenging 
mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just 
mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at 
elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will 
be required to solve most problems." I decided to work on them for a) fun, b) a
challenge and c) to learn more Scala.

My goal with each was to write a simple script for each problem which would 
output the answer and only the answer. Some of the solutions are somewhat of the 
brute force variety, but most are a genuine attempt at a clever and efficient 
solution.

INSTRUCTIONS

Simply pick a Scala file and run:

$ scala EulerProblem[xyz].scala

where [xyz] refers to the 3-digit suffix on the file name. That's it.
